# Image-Generation-Using-GAN-Model-with-TFGAN-library
Understanding and Implementing Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) on MNIST data using TF-GAN library using tensorflow V2

-> GAN composed of Generator network and Discriminator network.

-> It's a powerful framework for training two neural networks to compete against each other in order to generate realistic data.
